* Installing Circuit Python (for Circuit Playground).
  * Go here: https://circuitpython.org/board/circuitplayground_express/
  * Download the 9.x version of CircuitPython (.uf2).
  * You *can* download that directly to the CPLAYBOOT drive.
  * After the download, the Circuit Playground should unmount and remount as CIRCUITPY.
  * At this point the NeoPixels should rapidly flash yellow three times, and then 
    occasionally give a quick green flash.
* Development Environment(s)
  * For school: use https://code.circuitpython.org/
    * Note that each of these steps might take 0 - 15 seconds.  Be (somewhat) patient.
    * Connect your Circuit Playground using USB.
    * After you click CONNECT and USB, you should see a dialog which has 
      "CircuitPython CDC Connect (COMxx) - Paired"
      as an option.  Select that one, and click [Connect].
    * If this is working, you should see a spinning Python animation (ouroboros),
      and the neopixels will turn white.
    * Then select the CIRCUITPY drive as the "host folder."
