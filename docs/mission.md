# Modular Playground

## Mission Statement(s)

### Meta-Pedagogical Mission

The broadest mission of the Modular Playground is to create a long term, open ended project ecosystem for intermediate-level high school microcontroller programming and software product development.

Desirable characteristics:

  * the overall system should be usable *and engaging* to at least some high school students;
  * each module runs on standard, relatively inexpensive microcontroller development boards already widely owned by US schools;
  * the coding skills needed to contribute a genuinely useful module is within reach of a student who has successfully completed AP Computer Science Principles;

### General Guidelines
  * creating components that interact with other modular music making tools and technologies are good, particularly using USB-MIDI or analog triggers or control voltages;
  * additional support hardware should be kept simple and commonly accessible;
  * some open source CAD work and 3d printing is good;
  * soldering is to be avoided;
  * Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) software is to be avoided.
