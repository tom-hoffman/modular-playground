micro:bit notes
===============

In addition to the Circuit Playground, the "other" widely used microcontroller board used in classrooms is the BBC micro:bit.  I've been focusing on the Circuit Playground but also am fortunate to have a couple class sets of micro:bits.  For someone who is not an expert in these devices, working out the differences between the two, for music making and synthesis in particular, are complex.
