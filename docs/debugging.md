Debugging Checklists
====================

USB-MIDI in general
-------------------

* Is everything on the right channel (+ or - 1 channel!)
* Did any cables come unplugged?
* Did any power buttons on the USB hub get turned off?
* Are any monitors showing traffic?
  * LEDs on Yamaha 5-pin adapter?
  * CircuitPlayground LCD gizmo?
  * any flashing red LEDs on CPXs?

Nord Drum
---------

* Do you hear the output of the trigger button?
  * If not, you probably have an audio problem...
    * Can you hear noise when you touch the plug or plug into something else?
      * No: you definitely have an audio problem elsewhere.
      * Yes: if you can 
  * If yes, you probably have a MIDI problem.
* If MIDI is working on the network (see above)
  * Are we on the right MIDI channel?
  * Are the MIDI notes set correctly for each drum sound?
